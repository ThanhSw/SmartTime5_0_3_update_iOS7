1. Input your account settings\n\
2. Choose your sync type\n\
3. Map your calendars\n\
4. Select your sync start and end time\n\n\
Note: \n\n\
If you are using 1-way sync from ST->GCal and map with non-existing Google Calendars, SmartTime will automatically create those calendars for you the first time you perform a sync.\n\
The sync start time will always begin at 00:00:00 on Sunday of Week, or in day 1 of Month, or in day 1 of Year, \
and the sync end time will always end at 23:59:59 on Saturday of Week, or in day end of Month, or in day end of Year\n\n\
Tips:\n\n\
SmartTime logic combines Tasks and Events into one view then organizes them for you. To synchronize with Google Calendar, you can map to two separate GCal calendars for each SmartTime Calendar - one for tasks, and one for events. \
For example, your \"Family\" project could map to two GCal calendars called \"Family Tasks\" and \"Family Events.\"  If you already have calendars in GCal, SmartTime will locate those for you and give you the option to map Calendars to those. \n\n\
Remember:\n\n\
If you change the name of a calendar in GCal, you will need to manually re-map it to the corresponding SmartTime Calendar.\n\n\

"If you do not already have a Google Calendar account, please create one at www.google.com/calendar\n\nThen, in SmartTime:\n\n\
1. Input your Account settings\n\
2. Choose Your Sync Type\n\n\
The Basics:\n\n\
SmartTime logic combines Tasks and Events into one view then organizes them for you. In this free version, you can synchronize Events from \
your default Calendar with the events in your default Google Calendar.  In SmartTime, your default Calendar is \"SmartTime\".  In Google Calendar, \
your default Calendar is typically \"[UserName]gmail.com\".  SmartTime will automatically sync the two calendars.\n\n\
Quick Start:\n\n\
1) Tap \"Google Calendar Account\" and input your Google UserName and Password.\n\
2) Tap \"Check validity\" and wait a few seconds for confirmation that the info you entered is correct.\n\
3) That's it!  Sync.  We suggest two-way to combine the Events from the default calendars in SmartTime and Google Calendar.\n\n\
Note:\n\n\
1) To sync both Events and To Do's for all of your SmartTime Calendars, upgrade to SmartTime Plus.\n\
2) Importing or syncing large databases from your Google Calendar can adversely affect performance.";
