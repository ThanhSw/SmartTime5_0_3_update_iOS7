If you do not already have a Google Calendar account, please create one at <a href='http://www.google.com/calendar'>http://www.google.com/calendar</a><br/><br/>
Then, in SmartTime:<br/><br/>
1. Input your Account settings<br/>
2. Choose Your Sync Type<br/><br/>
The Basics:<br/><br/>
SmartTime logic combines Tasks and Events into one view then organizes them for you. In this free version, you can synchronize Events from 
your default Project with the events in your default Google Calendar.  In SmartTime, your default Project is "SmartTime".  In Google Calendar, 
your default Calendar is typically "[UserName]@gmail.com".  SmartTime will automatically sync the two calendars.<br/><br/>
Quick Start:<br/><br/>
1) Tap "Google Calendar Account" and input your Google UserName and Password.<br/>
2) Tap "Check validity" and wait a few seconds for confirmation that the info you entered is correct.<br/>
3) That's it!  Sync.  We suggest two-way to combine the Events from the default calendars in SmartTime and Google Calendar.<br/><br/>
Note:<br/><br/>
1) To sync both Events and To Do's for all of your SmartTime Projects, upgrade to SmartTime Plus.<br/>
2) Importing or syncing large databases from your Google Calendar can adversely affect performance.";
